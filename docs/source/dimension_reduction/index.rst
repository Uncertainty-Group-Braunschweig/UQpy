Dimension Reduction
====================

.. automodule:: UQpy.dimension_reduction

This module contains various classes and methods to perform dimensionality reduction in :py:mod:`UQpy`. The module is structured around the "manifold assumption", i.e., that high dimensional data lie close to a lower-dimension manifold. :py:mod:`.dimension_reduction` offers point-wise dimensionality reduction of a dataset via projection on the Grassmann manifold. This module provides a collection of Grassmann distances and kernels that encode the proximity between points on the Grassmann manifold. This module also provides an efficent implementation of  Diffusion maps method that aim to find a low-dimensional embedding of this manifold, and the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and  Higher-order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) methods, that can be used for data reconstruction and dimension reduction for solution snapshots in the form of second-order tensors.
